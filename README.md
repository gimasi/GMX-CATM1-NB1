# GMX-CATM1-NB1
GMX Module for CAT M1/NB1 Network based on the Quectel BG96 module.<br/>
This is a very first (working) version as you can see from the pictures on the Quectel module it says 'Engineering Sample'.<br/>

<br/>
Included in this first initial repository is a sketch to be used with the Tuino.<br/>
The sketch turns on the module, the module has a startup pin that need to cycled correctly, and redirects the BG96 Quectel serial port over to the USB port of the Tuino so that you can start doing preliminary tests on a network from a serial terminal.<br/>
